# City Permitting Agent - Evaluation Framework

## Overview
This evaluation framework provides comprehensive testing for the City Permitting Agent to ensure 
reliable, accurate, and compliant permit application pre-screening.

## Key Evaluation Categories

### 1. Functional Accuracy Metrics
- **Completeness Detection Accuracy**: Measures how accurately the agent identifies missing required fields
- **Compliance Assessment Accuracy**: Evaluates correctness of regulatory compliance scoring
- **Risk Classification Accuracy**: Tests proper categorization of applications by risk level
- **False Positive/Negative Rates**: Tracks incorrect approvals/rejections

### 2. Performance & Efficiency Metrics
- **Response Latency**: Time from application submission to scorecard generation
- **Throughput**: Number of applications processed per hour
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and GPU utilization during processing
- **Cost per Application**: Total computational cost per permit review

### 3. RAG System Evaluation
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: How well the system retrieves relevant permit requirements
- **Context Relevance**: Quality of retrieved regulatory context for each application
- **Grounding**: Percentage of responses based on actual permit requirements vs. hallucinations
- **Citation Accuracy**: Correct attribution to specific regulatory sources

### 4. Agent Behavior Metrics
- **Consistency**: Same application yields same results across multiple runs
- **Robustness**: Performance under edge cases and malformed inputs
- **Fairness**: Equal treatment regardless of business type or applicant characteristics
- **Explainability**: Quality and clarity of generated recommendations

### 5. Business Impact Metrics
- **Human Review Reduction**: Percentage of applications auto-processed vs. flagged for manual review
- **Processing Time Improvement**: Reduction in average permit processing time
- **Accuracy vs. Human Reviewers**: Agreement rate with expert human assessments
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from permit applicants and city staff

## Test Data Categories

### Synthetic Test Cases
- **Complete Applications**: Perfect submissions with all required fields
- **Incomplete Applications**: Missing various required documents/information
- **Non-Compliant Applications**: Violations of specific regulatory requirements
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual business types, special circumstances

### Real-World Test Data
- **Historical Applications**: Past permit applications with known outcomes
- **Anonymized Current Applications**: Recent submissions for validation
- **Cross-Domain Applications**: Different business types (food trucks, restaurants, etc.)

### Adversarial Test Cases
- **Malformed Inputs**: Corrupted or invalid application data
- **Boundary Testing**: Applications at compliance thresholds
- **Injection Attempts**: Potential security vulnerabilities
